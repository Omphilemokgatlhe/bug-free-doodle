    <h3>
      determining the water mateoric water line of North West and Gauteng
      province.
    </h3>
    <h5>ABSTRACT</h5>
    <p>
      The study of isotopes and understanding the rates and patterns of their
      presence in water have been an interest in hydrology study for years. The
      purpose of this study is to investigate the connection between the global
      water meteoric water lines and the local meteoric water lines mainly in
      the cities within the North West Province. This information is very
      valuable to Municipal Authorities of the two cities when evaluating the
      Ground water recharge and discharge from Acid Mine Drainage (AMD)
      pollution due to Radionuclides leakages into the water systems. Using the
      Picarro Cavity Ringdown Spectrometry technique, (Picarro L2130- Isotopic
      H2O isotope analyser), we were able to analyse the water samples collected
      from both provinces and measured them against the similar study conducted
      in 2021. The Results showed that the Mahikeng (in the North West Province)
      local meteoric water lines and its D-Excess are lower than the global
      water meteoric water lines D-Excess, indicating the Dry region of the
      North West Province and its effect on Land decontamination via reduction
      of AMD. Gauteng province has an even lower (1,422) D-Excess value but has
      more Land affected / contaminated by AMD. Further studies are needed to
      establish the causal relationship and patterns of Radionuclide (in AMD,
      etc.) and (Underground) Land contamination.

    <h5>INTRODUCTION</h5>
    <p>
      The study of isotopes in hydrology have been done for years, in 1961 Dr
      Craig after spending 16 years collecting water isotope samples of
      precipitation, surface water basically all meteoric direct water, he then
      measured them and plotted what is known as the GWML (global water meteoric
      water line). which describes the relationship between delta O-18 ( δ18_O)
      and delta deuterium or H-2 ( δ2_H ) of water in precipitation worldwide.
      Dr Craig describes it as δD=8*δ18_O + 10, which is known as the equation
      of a straight line is given by y=mx +c so the description of the GWML is
      drowned from that equation. Which is giving the inside into the overall
      relationship that water isotopes are expected to have. By doing that Dr
      Craig generated something that localised data can be compared to. What
      this tells us is how much water evaporation the collected samples
      experienced. when analysing the local slope and discover that it is lower
      than the global meteoric water line one that implies that the local slope
      experienced some certain levels of evaporation and the percentage of
      evaporation of that water body can be determined. That can help to look at
      things like stagnation which mean if the water body is stagnant it is
      going to experience an extreme amount of evaporation and the slope will
      drastically be below the global meteoric water line. Why the interest in
      the study of isotopes? This is because of their differences in masses.
      Them having different masses means they have different preferential
      accumulation in water. When evaporation occurs, the lighter isotopes
      prefer to be in the vapour phase while the heavier isotopes remain in the
      water. This process of the separation of isotopes is called fractionation.
      This is how mechanism of recharge is characterised, which is the process
      of the hydrologic cycle when rain water flows into the underlying
      aquifers. That is how they are able to be in the study of hydrology.
      (Reynaga, Millaire et al. 2021) “Overall, the dataset is useful in
      developing interpolated maps of water stable isotopes for relevant
      archaeological, bioarchaeological, forensic, hydrogeological, and
      ecological research. “ and also (Wang, Zhang et al. 2018) The local
      meteoric water line (LMWL) reflects the relationship between stable oxygen
      and hydrogen isotopes.

    <h5>PROBLEM STATEMENT</h5>
    <p>
      The purpose of the study is to analyse the heavier isotopes in the
      underground water of the region Gauteng and North West provinces. There is
      comparison of their WML (water meteoric line. Where in this case our
      depended variable is the number of isotopes that is contained in the water
      samples, the independent variable is the water samples and our controlled
      variable will be the temperature which should be kept constant as it can
      affect the accuracy of the experiment.

    <h4>METHOD AND MATERIAL</h4>
    <h5>MATERIAL</h5>
    <p>
      Water samples from different cities within Gauteng and North West
      provinces were used.
    </p>
    <h5>METHOD</h5>

    <h6>COLLECTION</h6>

    <p>
      The samples were collected from bore whole from different cities within
      the two provinces GP AND NW. the cities include Pretoria, Mafikeng,
      Rustenburg, Lichtenburg etc. and they were sealed into small tubes. DATA
      ANALYSIS The duration of the experiment was four days, The first day we
      went to the department of water science and management lab and we were
      guided on how to use the machine, we were given the manuals and how long
      it will take to get the results. The second day the apparatus was gathered
      and proceeded with the experiment, while kept at room temperature. the
      samples were then transferred into Auto sample vails which are small
      containers that are used in the PICARRO L2130-I isotopic H_2O t PICARRO
      L2130-I isotopic H_2O the water samples were transferred using a syringe
      and clarinet syringe filters. The syringe filters were changed every after
      three times of use. The samples that were gathered in total were
      thirty-one in number. The underground water samples were analysed using
      the PICARRO L2130-I isotopic H_2O isotope analyser at the Department of
      water science and management at North West University (Potchefstroom
      campus) with the assistance of Theuns De Klerk .
    </p>
    <br />
    <p>
      There are other machines or water analysers that can be used to analyse
      the water samples, (Durowoju, Odiyo et al. 2019) used thermos delta V mass
      spectrometer connected to gas bench to analyse their water samples. .
      (Mathuthu, Mokhine et al. 2021) also conducted a similar study and used a
      water analyser of the same brand but a different model The PICARRO L2140-I
      isotopic H_2 O . The PICARRO is a brand that develops their machine and
      add some new features to develop the machine’s capability and
      compatibility. The PICARRO L2130-i which is the model of choice for this
      project has two high throughput modes in addition to the original Standard
      mode. The Express mode delivers faster high-precision measurements for up
      to 500 injections per day. The Survey mode makes super-fast approximations
      of isotopic values for very large sample batches—up to 900 injections per
      day. With these approximations researchers can more efficiently sort and
      rearrange sample clusters to reduce memory effects, accelerating the
      measurement process and increasing the accuracy of the results. The
      PICARRO L2130-I isotopic H_2 O provides high precision measurements of
      δ18_O and δD and also up to 50 samples a day and it makes fast
      approximations of isotopic values for up to 900 injections per day. What
      it does is that it measures the isotopes and it uses cavity ring down
      spectrometry to separate the isotopes because they have different weights
      for example oxygen-16 and oxygen-18, both 18 and 16 refers to their
      weight, so them having different mass number makes it easy for them to
      separate and have machine to analyse them separately. The ratio of the
      heavier isotope to the light isotope, that ratio is a temperature
      dependent ratio. When temperature in the atmosphere rises the ratio
      increases and when it decreases the ratio also decreases. To solve the
      problem of temperature affecting the results, hydrologists came up with
      using water of known composition standard, the Vienna standard mean ocean
      water which is the average measurement of ocean water from around the
      world. The samples are specially prepared and the known isotopic
      composition of them is used by running them alongside the samples to be
      measured. Good results could be obtained by using that and the error
      associated with the standards because the composition of it is known, the
      same error can be applied for the samples to be measured. The ratio
      measurements are reported as the difference between the measurement of the
      samples collected compared to what was measured of the known composition.
      The parts per thousand concentration of the heavier isotopes which
      hydrogen-2 and oxygen-18. so, by using these ratios, meteoric water lines
      can be created and this is by plotting hydrogen -2 vs oxygen-18, in the
      graph the they are symbolised by the lower-case Greek letter’s deltas. The
      ratio represents the difference between the measured standards and the
      measured samples. (Durowoju, Odiyo et al. 2019) Hydrogen (D) and oxygen
      (O-18) isotopic compositions of precipitation are useful tools to
      delineate the nature of precipitation, groundwater recharge and
      climatological investigations. This study investigated the isotopic
      composition of 12 rainfall occurrences at Thohoyandou, with the objective
      of generating the local meteoric water line (LMWL) and determining the
      factors controlling the isotopic composition of the rain. The delta
      (delta) values for D and O-18 of the samples were determined using a
      Thermo Delta V mass spectrometer connected to a Gasbench. Thohoyandou
      rainwater showed a wide range of stable isotope values; delta D values of
      the rainwater varied from -76.3 parts per thousand to +22.7 parts per
      thousand (SMOW) with a weighted mean of -9.8 parts per thousand and delta
      O-18 values ranged from -10.78 parts per thousand to +3.07 parts per
      thousand (SMOW) with a weighted mean of -2.7 parts per thousand.
      delta-values of rainwater were more enriched during winter and more
      depleted during summer, due to the amount of rainfall and seasonal effect.
      The LMVVL in Thohoyandou is defined by delta D = 7.56 delta O-18 + 10.64,
      which shows a similar slope to the global meteoric water line (GMWL) but
      with a slightly higher intercept, of 10.64 parts per thousand instead of
      10 parts per thousand. This implies that the process of rain formation in
      Thohoyandou occurred under equilibrium conditions which are not
      significantly affected by evaporation. The slightly higher d-intercept
      value above the GMWL reflects an additional supply of recycled moisture
      across the regions. This implies that there is no continental effect but
      inland moisture from various water bodies and vegetation.
